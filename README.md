## What is W1X Debloat?
W1X Debloat is a small PowerShell script that optimizes your Windows 10/11 installation. It removes all bloatware, increases privacy and performance.

Originally created for personal use to quickly remove bloatware and disable intrusive Microsoft privacy settings after a fresh Windows 10/11 install. Friends found it helpful, so now it's publicly available. Enjoy!
