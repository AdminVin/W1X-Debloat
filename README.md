# W1X Debloat

## What is W1X Debloat?
W1X Debloat is a small PowerShell script that optimizes your Windows 10/11 installation. It removes all bloatware and increase performance.

I initially created this script for myself, specifically when I would re-install Windows on my computer, and had to turn off all the annoying bloatware that Microsoft included.  After it helped a few of my friends computers, I decided to make it publicly available. Enjoy!
